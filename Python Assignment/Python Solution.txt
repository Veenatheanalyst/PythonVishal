Assignment Part-1
Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?
Answer: A general-purpose programming language is one that is usable (not just theoretically, but practically) for solving a very wide range of different kinds of problems. 
In Python, you can write detailed numerical simulations, web microservices, file format parsers, and so on. So, Python is a general-purpose programming language. You would not want to use it to write a kernel extension, but general-purpose doesnâ€™t mean all possible purposes, just a wide variety of them.
